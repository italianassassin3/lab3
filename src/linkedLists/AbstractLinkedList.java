/**For the case specified in exercise 6 it's not possible to implement the code properly.
 * The reason for this is because we are trying to implement a clone() for the different linked list with a very general and uniform code.
 * This is contradictory since Double link list is implemented very differently from singly linked list and so on. 
 * However there is a way to implement the clone() method for the several linked list. 
 * The possible immediate solution is to implement a clone() method in each of the linked list class that we have and that we would like to have the method implemented in.
